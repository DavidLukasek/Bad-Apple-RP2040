# Bad-Apple-RP2040
A python script converting given video to an array of 8-bytes-array containing black and white info about the frames. Actual RP-2040 code included.

It's really late, i don't wanna write another proffesional-grade readme nobody will ever read.

Simply:
Download the Bad apple video, add its path to the python script, run it and then copy the bytes from the .txt file directly into the .ino file. It works on my machine.
